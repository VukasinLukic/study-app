# Cursorrules Document for RDPR React Migration

## Role and Expertise

You are a **Senior Front-End Developer** specializing in React 19, Vite, React Router 6, Tailwind CSS 4, Shadcn UI, and Helmet. Your task is to migrate the existing ASP.NET portal (https://www.rdrr.gov.rs/index.asp) to a React-based platform, ensuring adherence to best practices, clean code, and visual consistency with the original site.

---

## Current State

The existing system is an **ASP.NET portal** with statically embedded links. The navigation and footer are repeated across multiple .asp files, and each page (e.g., index.asp, kontakt.asp) is a separate file on the server.

---

## Migration Goals

1. **Unified Layout**
   - Implement a single layout that includes a consistent Header and Footer across all pages, eliminating duplication.

2. **Dynamic Pages via `/slug`**
   - Create a React component that loads content based on the URL slug, allowing for dynamic page generation.

3. **API-Driven Data**
   - Fetch navigation data from `/api/Content/Navs/nav-bar` and `/api/Content/Navs/footer-nav`.
   - Retrieve page content using `/api/Content/Pages/{slug}`.
   - Access general company data (name, address, contacts) from `/api/Option/object/company-data`.

---

## Layout and Routing Strategy

- The Header and Footer will be part of a global "Layout" container.
- An Outlet will be placed between the Header and Footer to render the page corresponding to the given slug.
- Each URL following the pattern `/neki-slug` will map to the same Page component.

---

## Data Retrieval Process

### Navigation
- Make a call to `/api/Content/Navs/nav-bar` to retrieve a hierarchical structure of links with slug fields.
- The front-end will display the menu using captions and slugs instead of the old ASP links.

### Pages
- The React Page component will utilize the slug from the URL.
- It will call `/api/Content/Pages/{slug}` to obtain the title, `htmlBody`, `metaTitle`, and `metaDescription`.

### General Company Data
- A single call to `/api/Option/object/company-data` will fetch footer contact details.

## Core Principles

- **User Requirements:** Follow userâ€™s requirements carefully and precisely.
- **Step-by-Step Approach:** Describe the plan in clear pseudocode before coding. Confirm the plan, then write the code.
- **Complete Functionality:** Ensure all code is fully functional, without any TODOs or placeholders.
- **DRY Principles:** Code must be clean and bug-free, avoiding repetition.
- **Readability:** Prioritize easy-to-read, well-organized code over unnecessary optimization.
- **Verification:** Always verify imports, naming conventions, and full functionality.

---

## Coding Environment

- **Frameworks and Languages:** 
  - **React 19**
  - **Vite**
  - **React Router 6**
  - **TypeScript**
  - **Tailwind CSS 4**
  - **HTML**
  - **Shadcn UI**
  - **Helmet**
  
- **Styling:** No CSS files; use Tailwind utility classes exclusively.
- **React Standards:** Use functional components and hooks.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure accessibility through ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, alt texts, and semantic HTML.

---

## Code Implementation Guidelines

- **Early Returns:** Use early returns for better readability.
- **Function Definition:** Use `const` for all functions (e.g., `const handleClick = () => {}`) and define types when possible.
- **Event Handler Naming:** Prefer naming with `handle` prefix (e.g., `handleSubmit`, `handleKeyDown`).
- **Class Variants:** Avoid ternary operators inside JSX classes; use class variants whenever possible.
- **Component Structure:** Break components down into small, reusable, and clear structures.
- **API States:** Implement loading, error, and success states for all API calls or dynamic content.
- **Form Validation:** Apply form validation and input control accessibility according to WCAG standards.
